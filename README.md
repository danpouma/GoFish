GoFish
======
 This game is player vs. computer.
 Player will choose a card from their hand and ask the computer for that card
 if computer has it then he will give you it and you will have a pair. If not,
 computer will go fish. Computer will remember the cards you ask for and use them
 against you to provide somewhat of a challenge. Winner is determined by whoever
 runs out of cards in their hand first or whoever has the most pairs when the deck
 runs out of cards.
